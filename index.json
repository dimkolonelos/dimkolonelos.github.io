During June and July 2023 I was a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley hosted by Sanjam Garg. From April to August 2021 I was a research intern at Ethereum Foundation working with Mary Maller. I received my Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens in 2018, where my Diploma thesis was advised by Aris Pagourtzis.\nI am broadly interested in the theoretical and applied aspects of Cryptography with a current focus on succinct cryptographic primitives with advanced functionalities, such as Succinct Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems, Vector Commitments and Set Accumulators, and their applications to public key cryptography and blockchain technology.\nMy CV [Last updated: September 18, 2023].
